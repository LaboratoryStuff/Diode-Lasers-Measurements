# Diode Lasers Measurements

This repository has measurment results of several laser diodes in the region of visible and near infrared. Results available inclued optical power vs applied current, optical power vs tempearture , among others.
The equipment used to perform the measurments and respective processing is briefly explained in the results files.

List of laser measured:

- Roithner Laser SHD5210MG : emission wavelength = 520 nm
- Roithner Laser S6305MG : emission wavelength = 635 nm (measurment of 3 different diodes)
- Roithner Laser S6705MG : emission wavelength = 670 nm
- Roithner Laser S9850MG : emission wavelength = 980 nm
